1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:01,166
what's going on YouTube

2
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:03,199
this is I'm doing sauna from hack the box

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,966
which is just a

4
00:00:03,966 --> 00:00:06,299
windows box with a web server and active directory

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,200
and start on it

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,000
we've done plenty of 80 in the past

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,966
the videos that come to mine

8
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:12,399
a real active sizzle and forest

9
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,200
the thing that really sets this one apart

10
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,500
is you can't just use

11
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:19,899
RPC client or L DAP to dump all the users on the box

12
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:20,899
instead we can kind of

13
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,566
do a boolean logic to check if a user exist

14
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,599
through kirbros pre authentication

15
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,399
essentially you give it a username if

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,066
kirbros responds with

17
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,300
pre authentication required

18
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,266
you know that user exist on the box

19
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,466
so we're going to go through the website of the box

20
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:37,733
pull a bunch of names off the site

21
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,133
and then use a bit of them

22
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:41,799
magic to convert those names into possible usernames

23
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:44,299
pass it into a tool called curb route

24
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,200
to find some valid usernames

25
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:47,533
and then with those usernames

26
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:49,799
pass it to some impacket scripts to do some as

27
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,066
rep roasting to get a

28
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,966
password hash of an account pass it to hashcat

29
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:56,699
crack it log into the box

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,600
and then once you log into the box

31
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,933
privasking is simply running

32
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,900
blood hound and wind peas

33
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:05,866
combining the 2 outputs and you can DC sync

34
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,333
so it probably sounds a lot more complicated than it is

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,800
so let's just jump in

36
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,266
as always we want to start over

37
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:13,333
the n map so dash s C for default scripts

38
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,966
s V enumerate versions O a I'll put all formats

39
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,933
print the n map directory and we have to create it

40
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,100
create the n map directory

41
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,066
and then we can call it sauna

42
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,300
1010 175

43
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,299
always want to run and map with pseudo

44
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,933
and then I'm gonna add a dash V flag

45
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,166
so we can see open ports as it finds it

46
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,500
we see 80 is open which is going to be a web server

47
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:43,100
53 DNS a bunch of um like SMB RPC ports

48
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know exactly what 3268 is

49
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:49,099
um don't know what five ninety three

50
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,600
I think 06:36 is encrypted L DAP

51
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,099
we see kerbros down here

52
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,933
so based upon saying 4 45 which is SMB

53
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,133
so we know there's a windows box

54
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:03,733
53 DNS and 88 kurbrose

55
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:07,133
I'm guessing this is a windows domain controller

56
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,133
so the very 1st thing I want to do is probably

57
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,733
enumerate 4 or 4 or 5

58
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:13,099
and then we'll move on to port 80

59
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,866
so let's do

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,733
crack map exec SMB 1010

61
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,766
175 to see

62
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,133
everything about this

63
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,866
hurst we see the hurst name is going to be sana

64
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:29,766
the domain name is egotistical dashbank dot local

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,866
signing is set to true and smbv1 is disabled

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,966
so

67
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:39,466
let's do shares to see if we can enumerate any shares

68
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,866
and we get a status use a chess and delete in

69
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:46,299
we can try a blank username password

70
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
to see if this gets around that

71
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,666
sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't

72
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,499
and we see access denied so we can't

73
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,966
we could try other tools like SMB map

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,666
I think it's dash I 10 1010 one 75 dash U dash

75
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,333
P

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
dash H

77
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,300
run

78
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,966
this and we don't really get anything

79
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,066
so

80
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
good go and try a bunch of SMB tools
